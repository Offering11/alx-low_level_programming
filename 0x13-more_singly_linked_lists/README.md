STILL ON SINGLY LINKED LIST

A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.

way to display linked list:

Create a class Node which has two attributes: data and next. Next is a pointer to the next node.
Create another class which has two attributes: head and tail.
addNode() will add a new node to the list: Create a new node. ...
display() will display the nodes present in the list
